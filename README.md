# ts2reason

Automatic generation of ReasonML bindings using TypeScript definitions.

> ** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT **

I just started to learn ReasonML and something that I'm missing is the ability to find definitions for popular javascript libraries as we have for TypeScript on DefinitelyTyped.

Inspired by the [ts2fable](https://github.com/fable-compiler/ts2fable) project, my ambition with this project is to create a tool to generate ReasonML bindings from TypeScript definition.

> Do not expect to find something usable now

See the [spec](./spec.md) for more details.
